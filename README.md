# Realtime-object-recognition-YOLO (Work in progress).

This is a multi-threaded implementation of realtime object recognition based on YOLOv3.

Make sure the library requirements are met. Then open the notebook and follow the instructions.

Known Issues:
- Unoptimized NMS algorithm.
- Out of frame bounding box label.
- Slow FP32 inference.
- Only YOLOv3 supported.
- Requires IPython.
